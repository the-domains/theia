Theia: the Universe in motion

Today, two of the most intriguing questions of our modern Science are: what is the nature of what we call "Dark Matter" in the Universe? and which "Sun-like"stars harbour real "Earth-like" habitable planets?

The answer of both questions relies on very precise astrometric measurements. Theia is a space mission concept designed to address these questions.
