# Habitable Exo-Earths

There should be plenty of planets like the Earth, lying inside the habitable zone of stars just like our Sun. But we do not know where they are. Theia will detect and characterize the masses and orbits of these planets around our nearmost Sun-like stars. Theia will pave the way for finding life elsewhere in the Universe.
